## General 
This is a project for me to learn and share my learning with others. I wanted to make something for everyone that anyone could use and make their clients on.
This project will probably not get updated unless a large amount of people demand me to make something.

## Information:
The Keybind for ClickGui by default is `rshift`. You can change this in the module initializer.
